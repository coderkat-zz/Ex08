I write books, I code, I make music. 
You may ask, why am I so full of myself? 
Good question, and I guess you should ask 
why someone so full of themselves would 
care what you think? Now you have an answer. 
I've written tons of code. 
Some of it is here, 
most of it is in dead software 
at dead companies. 
I used to enjoy writing software 
for other people, but now I enjoy 
writing it for myself only. I make 
music and record my practice sessions.
 Honestly I don't give a fuck if you like it or not. 
 I do it because it makes me happy and it's fun.
Yes I say "fuck", and quite a lot of "bad words", 
mostly because it's funny to watch 
you shit your pants at them. 
It's not like you're going to give me a job 
so fuck it, 
I'll say fuck. 
fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck
Did I mention? 
fuck 
I also build
guitars
I use my skills at electronics and woodworking to build instruments I want to play. I play them in most of my music. I write books that teach people what I know about computers. A lot of people have learned to code from them, so if you want to learn to code, go read one. I am much nicer in my books and they are PG-13. I write essays and rants that entertain people. I may start writing fiction soon too. It may have music in it.
Use a spacebar or arrow keys to navigate

Wait a minute, is this some kind of trick? I thought BSD was all about “true freedom” to use their code? When did they start getting pissy about people not returning the favor? I thought that whole “viral” thing was why they hated the GPL? I guess I’m not in Lawrence, Kansas anymore.

What I’m seeing is the following double standard among BSD license users:


…whether or not you get to use their code in return.

And remember, you say the complaint is you can’t use my code, but you also can’t use Apple’s code, or even see it, and they’ll sue you if you try to even look at it, or talk about it. At least Lamson is a server you can use all you want and probably never have to release.


The real problem here is that a bunch of people who give software away get mad at other people who give software away because of some retarded difference in their interpretation of “free”.

For fuck’s sake, we’re both on the same damn side! Petty squabbling over bullshit like this, and even worse doing it in such a contradictory way, is stupid. This kind of useless bickering doesn’t help promote excellent software and “freedom” to express yourself with code.

More importantly though, if you pick a license because of your particular beliefs and attitudes, stick to them. Don’t hold me to some weird “social pressure viral clause” because I choose a different license.

Because, I am releasing my code for you to use, unlike most of those corporations you seem to love.

However, I’d like to explain why I use the GPL after decades of writing open source software and after a couple of “successful” projects. These are my reasons for using it, and only apply to me and what I want to do with my software from now on. You are free to your own opinions and choices, and I hope you’ll respect mine.
It’s the author’s right

I believe that whatever the author wants to do with his or her works is their right. They wrote it, despite everyone telling them it wouldn’t work. They slaved over it rather than going out with friends. They debugged it, and wrote documentation for it so everyone else could use it. They may have even spent a part of their time promoting it and helping people with it. All for free, and for whatever reason they choose.

When you rip on a project or someone for their choice of license you are being gigantic jerk. They worked on it, not you. At a minimum you’re insulting someone’s belief in open source and free software, and how they feel it should progress in our culture.

At the worst you are being ungrateful turds because someone is giving you a piece of software, but you insult their work not on its technical merits, but on a license file you disagree with.

I really don’t care what license people use on their software, it’s their software and bitching at them for the license they choose is offensive. They wrote it, put their blood and sweat into it, and you should be glad that you get the privilege of even seeing it.


Because I want to, and if you disagree with it then don’t use my software. It’s as simple as that.

I don’t want to be ignored again
